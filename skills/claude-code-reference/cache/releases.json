      "features": [],
      "rawBody": "## What's changed\n\n- Added session resume hint on exit, showing how to continue your conversation later\n- Added support for full-width (zenkaku) space input from Japanese IME in checkbox selection\n- Fixed PDF too large errors permanently locking up sessions, requiring users to start a new conversation\n- Fixed bash commands incorrectly reporting failure with \"Read-only file system\" errors when sandbox mode was enabled\n- Fixed a crash that made sessions unusable after entering plan mode when project config in `~/.claude.json` was missing default fields\n- Fixed `temperatureOverride` being silently ignored in the streaming API path, causing all streaming requests to use the default temperature (1) regardless of the configured override\n- Fixed LSP shutdown/exit compatibility with strict language servers that reject null params\n- Improved system prompts to more clearly guide the model toward using dedicated tools (Read, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of bash equivalents (`cat`, `sed`, `grep`, `find`), reducing unnecessary bash command usage\n- Improved PDF and request size error messages to show actual limits (100 pages, 20MB)\n- Reduced layout jitter in the terminal when the spinner appears and disappears during streaming\n- Removed misleading Anthropic API pricing from model selector for third-party provider (Bedrock, Vertex, Foundry) users\n"

      "features": [],
      "rawBody": "## What's changed\n\n- Added `pages` parameter to the Read tool for PDFs, allowing specific page ranges to be read (e.g., `pages: \"1-5\"`). Large PDFs (>10 pages) now return a lightweight reference when `@` mentioned instead of being inlined into context.\n- Added pre-configured OAuth client credentials for MCP servers that don't support Dynamic Client Registration (e.g., Slack). Use `--client-id` and `--client-secret` with `claude mcp add`.\n- Added `/debug` for Claude to help troubleshoot the current session\n- Added support for additional `git log` and `git show` flags in read-only mode (e.g., `--topo-order`, `--cherry-pick`, `--format`, `--raw`)\n- Added token count, tool uses, and duration metrics to Task tool results\n- Added reduced motion mode to the config\n- Fixed phantom \"(no content)\" text blocks appearing in API conversation history, reducing token waste and potential model confusion\n- Fixed prompt cache not correctly invalidating when tool descriptions or input schemas changed, only when tool names changed\n- Fixed 400 errors that could occur after running `/login` when the conversation contained thinking blocks\n- Fixed a hang when resuming sessions with corrupted transcript files containing `parentUuid` cycles\n- Fixed rate limit message showing incorrect \"/upgrade\" suggestion for Max 20x users when extra-usage is unavailable\n- Fixed permission dialogs stealing focus while actively typing\n- Fixed subagents not being able to access SDK-provided MCP tools because they were not synced to the shared application state\n- Fixed a regression where Windows users with a `.bashrc` file could not run bash commands\n- Improved memory usage for `--resume` (68% reduction for users with many sessions) by replacing the session index with lightweight stat-based loading and progressive enrichment\n- Improved `TaskStop` tool to display the stopped command/task description in the result line instead of a generic \"Task stopped\" message\n- Changed `/model` to execute immediately instead of being queued\n- [VSCode] Added multiline input support to the \"Other\" text input in question dialogs (use Shift+Enter for new lines)\n- [VSCode] Fixed duplicate sessions appearing in the session list when starting a new conversation\n"

Previously `allow: [\"Bash\"], ask: [\"Bash(rm *)\"]` allowed all bash commands, but will now permission prompt for `rm`.\n- Windows: Fixed bash command execution failing for users with `.bashrc` files\n- Windows: Fixed console windows flashing when spawning child processes\n- VSCode: Fixed OAuth token expiration causing 401 errors after extended sessions\n"
